            <div class="bio">
                <p>Born in Shenzhen, China, I live, study, and work in New York and Shenzhen. Currently I’m pursing my bachelor’s degree of Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Working as a milinery designer for five years, traditional craft and its sincere way of expression are inseparable parts of my design. Though those craftsmanship are always the most heart-touching elements of my work, I’m still in the exploration of connecting them with modern technology. </p>
            <br>
                <p>For me, the process of creating is arbitrary, led by personal inspiration and mood; it is also a kind of self-mediation. I like to create based on my subtle feelings regards life and everything that brings warmth and hope. Listening to, being sensible and sensitive, and paying attention to a variety of entities bring to my work through the medium of fashion products, sculptures, photography and UI/UX designs.</p>
